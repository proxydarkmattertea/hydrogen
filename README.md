This is a music bot with basic features. Will be adding more to it soon.

*Since I'm quite new to this I used a few sources to help build the frame of the bot, though this was simply to understand how things can or can't fit together and how they come together to make a working product. The final release of this project will (hopefully) be different [unique/original] approaches to making this bot possible.*
